Server Design

Server is an app that runs and processes messages real time. Data in and out.
The following are components:

- ReplayableQueueListener
    - onMessage(Entity msg,...): triggered when there is a message arrived. Its role is to
    relay the message on a storage (in memory, in file) for assigned processors to consume
- Engine : the implementor of ReplayableQueueListener
- MessagingAdapter: send/receive messages
- Server -- this is the main() app, entry point
   - bootstrap all processes: engine, message adaptor, processor, db
   - initialize configs
   - start processes
   - shutdown processes
